It's similar to [Easy Window Switcher](https://neosmart.net/EasySwitch/) but it supports more programs (for instance TablePlus), handles minimized windows and is open source.

*The key `` ` `` (`backtick`) is above the `TAB` key on QWERTY keyboard but even if your keyboard is not QWERTY, the shortcut will be mapped to the key above the `TAB` key.*

**Compatible Windows 10+ only!**
